# Detect Technologies internship

The 2 folders in this repository each contain the work I have done while working for Detect Techonologies during the
summer of 2018. Further details are enclosed within.

> Note : the optical flow tracking folder does not contain the actual video feed I eventually worked on during the
  internship. It contains a toy example video that I tested the scripts on in the office, before implementing it on the
  actual data. For confidentiality reasons, I cannot share the original dataset.
> But the scripts that I have displayed are more or less the same as the final scripts, with minor modifications to
  preprocessing the original video feed.
